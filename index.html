    <h1>HTML: The foundation of the <em>entire</em> web</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML, or <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>, is the <strong>foundational</strong> language of the web. It's used to <em>structure and organize content</em> on websites, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Imagine HTML as the <strong>blueprint</strong> that defines how a webpage should look and what elements it should contain. As a beginner, learning HTML is like gaining the power to create your own <em>digital canvas</em>, where you can arrange text and media to build web pages that everyone can see and interact with.</p>
    <h2>Basic HTML structure</h2>
    <p>The <strong>HTML Boilerplate</strong> is a <strong>starting point</strong> for creating web pages. It's like a <em>ready-to-use framework</em> that provides the <strong>essential structure</strong> for your webpage. When you begin coding a new webpage, you can use the <strong>HTML boilerplate</strong> to save time. In the boilerplate, you'll find the <strong><!DOCTYPE> declaration</strong>, which tells the browser that you're using HTML5. Then, there's the <strong>html</strong> element that wraps everything. Inside the <strong>html</strong> element, you have the <strong>head</strong> section where you can include metadata like the page title and links to external resources like stylesheets and scripts. The <strong>most important part</strong> is the <strong>body</strong> section. This is where you put your actual contentâ€”text, images, links, and more. The <strong>HTML boilerplate</strong> gives you a <strong>solid structure</strong> to build upon.</p>
    <h2>HTML Elements and Attributes</h2>
    <p><strong>HTML elements</strong> are the building blocks of a webpage. They are represented by tags and define different parts of a page's content.</p>
    <p><em>Attributes</em> provide additional information about an element. They are used within the opening tag and modify the element's behavior or appearance.</p>
    <h2>Nesting and Indentation</h2>
    <p><strong>Nesting</strong> involves placing one HTML element inside another. Proper nesting maintains the hierarchy and structure of your content.</p>
    <p><em>Indentation</em> is the practice of aligning nested elements with consistent spacing. It enhances code readability and organization.</p>
    <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
    <p>Some resources which you can use to learn HTML5 are: <em>Modzilla, W3 Schools, FreeCodeCamp, Youtube and The Odin Project.</em></p>
